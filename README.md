- [ ] Add correct teams in `Teams & Collaborators` settings
- [ ] Update CODEOWNERS  
      • Make sure you added teams in `Teams & Collaborators` before proceeding
      • Add correct codowners like `path/to/directory/&  @handson-code/correct-team`
- [ ] Always follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/#semantic-versioning-200), `vA.B.C` where A B and C are numbers `v1.2.3`  
      • Major changes update A: `v1.0.0` -> `v2.0.0`  
      • Minor changes update B: `v1.0.0` -> `v1.1.0`  
      • Patches and fixes change C: `v1.0.0` -> `v1.0.1`
      • `v` stays intact as this highlights that we are folloowing semantic versioning  
      • you can add `-beta` at the end like `v1.2.3-beta`  
      • you can add `-alpha` at the end like `v1.2.3-alpha`  
- [ ] Always follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) when commiting. Examples:  
      • `feat:` for adding new feature `feat: add api endpoint for user login` feature    
      • `fix:` for fixing stuff `fix: memory overflow` 
      • `test:` for testing out `test: button height` testing feature  
      • `BREAKING CHANGE:` for changes that can break system `BREAKING CHANGE: change database queries`  
      • `chore:` when doing manual work - `chore: update chart version`
- [ ] Follow branch naming as `Conventional Commits`  
      • `feat/`  for new feature branches `feat/api-user-login`  
      • `fix/` if you are working on `fix`  
      • `test/` if you are testing theoryu `test/change-ui-layout`  
      • `BREAKING CHANGE` falls under `feat/` branch

  > Here we have all permissions ready so it will simplify all the work
- Always add correct Teams in new repository.   
  > `Your Repository` -> `Settings` -> `Teams & Collaborators` and add teams like `systems`, `member` or `frontend`
